# CodeEval Solutions


## About

This repository houses my personal solutions to [CodeEval][ce]'s public
problems.

CodeEval takes execution speed and memory consumption into account (albeit
incorrectly at the time of this writing) when calculating ranking points.
C and C++ are therefore my languages of choice on this platform as they
generally yield the highest scores.

It is strongly encouraged that you do not view my solutions unless you've
already solved the relevant problems yourself.
